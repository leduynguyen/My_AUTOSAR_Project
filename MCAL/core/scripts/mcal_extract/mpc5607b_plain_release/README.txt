Mapping to extract mpc5607b MCAL files from Released ArcticCore.

Usage:
Run the mcal_extract script. Settings in config.py can be used to point to the CORE_BASE_DIR (core with all files) and MCAL_TARGET_DIR (empty core).
NOTE: Some files will be overwritten from this mapping folder.

Now it should be possible to create an example refering the new core and building it (it is not possible to run since some things has been stubbed).
